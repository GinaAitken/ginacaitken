            <p>My role at Optima Connect goes above and beyond any standard account management role. While the company deals in data engineering and analytics with a focus on marketing and communications, my expertise takes this into email marketing.  I deal with every aspect of the email marketing process including email code, day-to-day production & servicing, strategy advice, and reporting & insight. One of the best projects I was involved with involved intelligent use of data to increase effectiveness of email marketing campaigns which involved a 37% increase in revenue.</p>

              Dedication to training, loyalty to my teammates and trust in the wider support team have been key to my successes.

            <p>
              Through working at Optima Connect and at TPAS, proof-reading and sense-checking marketing material and customer experience journeys has been ciritcal to my career.
              Throughout university close analysis of text and image was a crucial aspect to my degree and my findings were reported in a variety of ways including on film, in web visualisations and essays.  
              In sport, I take particular pride in analysis of all the small details to gain a fuller understanding of and use the data to drive decisions and changes. 
              Some call it pedantic but I thoroughly believe the devil is in the detail.

            <p>Throughout university I chose to combine my studies with a career in curling.  
              This meant I had to develop exceptional organisation skills to prioritise academic assignments and sports goals to get everything done to the best possible standard.  
              This was successful as I can now boast a 2:1 Honours degree and a World Silver Medal in curling.
              
              While working at Optima Connect, I managed client queries, projects and services. This meant managing both internal team schedule and external client input.

              I can build good relationships with those with whom I work and I value being part of a strong team.

        <p>My interest in film and television led me to my University course to learn more about how the industry works from an idea to the finished product.
          While competing internationally, I took the opportunity to investigate the workings behind a live sports production which I found fascinating.
          I also enjoy documentaries, particularly around sport and the environment.</p>

            I am currently taking an online course from the University of Leeds which has widened my awareness of the complexity that surrounds sustainability.</p>
